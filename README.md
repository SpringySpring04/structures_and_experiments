# Structures and Experiments

Just a simple program I made to test out Linked Lists and other forms of Data Structures with TypeScript.

### Requirements

`node.js` and `npm`
* Look up how to install them if you don't already have it

### Developer Requirements

TypeScript (`npm install -g typescript`)

## How to run

Clone the repository onto your system. Can use GitHub (Desktop), install and extract as zip, or the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension

* VSCode:
    * Make sure you have TypeScript (for compilation) and NodeJS installed.
    * Open the folder in VSCode (top-level folder must be the one that contains this README file)
    * Press F5 or go to `Run > Start Debugging`.
    * It should output into the terminal

* Using Nodejs or npm:
    * Navigate to repository folder using a command terminal of your choice or just open the folder in file explorer and type 'cmd' in the address bar when opened to the folder
    * If using Node.JS:
        * Type `node build/app.js`
    * If using npm:
        * Type `npm start`.

## Notes

* This project may be using node.js but please note that this project is NOT an npm package and is just an experimental project I've been working on. 

## License Information

* Given the experimental and very low-effort nature of this project, you are totally free to reuse and recycle the main code of this project in the `src/` folder in your own projects. After all, this is mostly [freely available information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).
